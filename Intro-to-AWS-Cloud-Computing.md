#Introduction to AWS Cloud Computing

###Preamble
Cloud computing allows users to quickly access an arbitrary amount of compute resources from a distance without the need to buy or maintain hardware themselves. There are many cloud computing services. This tutorial describes the use of Amazon's Web Services ([AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/)) elastic compute (EC2) resource. 





Creation of this tutorial on Amazon AWS EC2 was generously supported by [Amazon AWS Education grants](http://aws.amazon.com/grants/).
