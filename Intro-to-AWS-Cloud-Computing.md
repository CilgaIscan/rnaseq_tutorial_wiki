#Introduction to AWS Cloud Computing

###Preamble
Cloud computing allows users to quickly access an arbitrary amount of compute resources from a distance without the need to buy or maintain hardware themselves. There are many cloud computing services. This tutorial describes the use of Amazon's Web Services ([AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/)) elastic compute (EC2) resource. 

###Creating an account
In order to use AWS the first time, you will have to create an account. In order to create and run instances as described in this tutorial, you will need to associate a credit card with that account for billing purposes. 

###Logging into the AWS console
To log into AWS, go to the [aws.amazon.com](http://aws.amazon.com/) and hit the [Sign In to the Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) button as shown below.
