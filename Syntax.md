#Syntax

In [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown), fenced code blocks are optional where as indented code blocks are required to complete the tutorial.

To make the Markdown files bash/shell compatible, a script will add a comment or '#' character to all lines that are NOT indendented with a TAB character.

In text form, all lines starting with a '#' are comments and will not be executed.  Therefore, [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks) will be ignored when converted to a bash script.
